# script

Regroupment of script that I've made to download multiple HDS stream, Change media title and convert them.


###download.sh###

You will need to put all the HDS link generated by the "HDS Link Detector" addon in a separate file and execute 
```
./download.sh file.txt
```
The script will now use User Input as for Title, Season, Resolution, first Episode, signature and output directory
resulting in a
```
title.seasonepisode.language.resolution.codec-signature.flv

ex. Oz.S01E01.720p.FRENCH.720p.H264-ROKe.flv
```

##Things to do

- [x] download.sh user input
- [x] download.sh language and codec option
- [ ] rework encode.sh with user input
- [ ] create a separate tv-show.sh and movie.sh from download.sh
- [ ] create encode.sh profile for easy encoding
- [ ] all-in-one script for downloading, encoding and maybe rsync with a server
- [ ] give users options as of downloading, encoding and/or rsync

- [ ] find website compatible with HDS and maybe yt-dl
