# script

Regroupment of script that I've made to download multiple HDS stream, Change media title and convert them.


download.sh : You will need to put all the HDS link generated by the "HDS Link Detector" addon in a separate file and execute 

  ./download.sh file.txt

  download.sh will now use User Input as for Title, Season, Resolution and first Episode
